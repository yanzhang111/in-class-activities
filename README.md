### W2
 1.The r, g, and b variables are floats because colors in Unity use numbers with decimals between 0.0 and 1.0. Using floats lets the color change smoothly instead of jumping by whole numbers.
2. The _bounces variable is an int because it counts how many times the ball hits something. It’s always a whole number, so using an integer makes sense.
3. The error said “; expected,” which means I forgot to put a semicolon at the end of the line. It showed that every line of code in C# needs a semicolon to run correctly.
