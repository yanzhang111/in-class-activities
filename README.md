I belong to Table 5, and I will be answering question 1.
Q: You’re building a rhythm game, and you’re writing a method named DidPlayerHitBeat that tells you whether or not the player accurately hit a beat based on the time that they pressed a key.
The input will include float x and float y. Float x refers to the moment when player's finger touches the screen. Float y refers to the moment when player's finger leaves the screen. In the body part of the method, we will substract y from x to obtain float z. If z is greater than 0.2s, then bool whetherHit equals true. The boolean type whetherHit variable will be the output.
Input: float x (touch time); float y (leave time)
Output type: boolean

1.Class is a family recipe for how to make and present a dish that has been passed down through different generations. Components are the printed version of the recipe in a cookbook. Method is the cooking steps for this dish. Member variables are the ingredients of this dish.
2.Regarding why balls get very bright after bouncing many times: each time a ball collides, its speed is multiplied by a speed factor, and if the speed exceeds a certain threshold, its color brightness is increased. Because balls in the scene collide frequently, the speed and brightness accumulate over time, causing balls that bounce many times to become extremely bright.

 1.The r, g, and b variables are floats because colors in Unity use numbers with decimals between 0.0 and 1.0. Using floats lets the color change smoothly instead of jumping by whole numbers.
2. The _bounces variable is an int because it counts how many times the ball hits something. It’s always a whole number, so using an integer makes sense.
3. The error said “; expected,” which means I forgot to put a semicolon at the end of the line. It showed that every line of code in C# needs a semicolon to run correctly.
